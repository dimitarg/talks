# About the talk

In this talk we are going to present a principled, robust and performant approach to interacting with RDBMS in the Java
programming language, implemented via the [sane-dbc](https://github.com/novarto-oss/sane-dbc) micro-library. We approach
the problem via plain old SQL, while utilizing the [DB Monad](https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava/blob/master/core/src/main/java/fj/control/db/DB.java)
to keep our programs sane (i.e. referentially transparent and boilerplate-free) and easy to reason about. 

Besides basic usage patterns, we are going to touch on topics such as
- Composition
- Threading
- Production-grade connection management
- Multithreaded correctness through immutability

The talk presumes no prerequisites besides intermediate command of Java, and basic knowledge of SQL.
